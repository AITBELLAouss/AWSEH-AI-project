## Introduction

This report documents the AWS pentesting process, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities related to misconfigured S3 bucket policies that could lead to unauthorized access or data leaks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this pentesting exercise is to identify any S3 buckets with misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) that might allow public access, therefore posing a security risk.

## Methodology

The following steps outline the methodology used to check for misconfigured bucket policies:

1. **Identify S3 Buckets**: List all S3 buckets in the AWS account.
2. **Retrieve Bucket ACL**: Use the AWS CLI to retrieve the ACL for each bucket.
3. **Analyze ACL Entries**: Inspect each ACL entry to identify permissions granted to 'Everyone' or 'AllUsers'.

## Tools Used

- **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) was used to interact with AWS services and retrieve bucket ACLs.

## Command Used

To check for misconfigured bucket policies, the following AWS CLI command was executed:

```sh
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME
```

## Results

### Bucket: example-bucket-1

**ACL Entries**:
```json
[
    {
        "Grantee": {
            "Type": "CanonicalUser",
            "ID": "example-canonical-user-id",
            "DisplayName": "example-user"
        },
        "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
    },
    {
        "Grantee": {
            "Type": "Group",
            "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
        },
        "Permission": "READ"
    }
]
```

**Analysis**:
- The ACL entry for the `AllUsers` group grants `READ` permission, indicating that the bucket is publicly accessible. This poses a potential security risk as anyone on the internet can read the contents of this bucket.

### Bucket: example-bucket-2

**ACL Entries**:
```json
[
    {
        "Grantee": {
            "Type": "CanonicalUser",
            "ID": "example-canonical-user-id-2",
            "DisplayName": "example-user-2"
        },
        "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
    }
]
```

**Analysis**:
- No public access permissions found. This bucket does not pose a security risk related to public access.

## Conclusion

The pentesting exercise revealed that `example-bucket-1` has misconfigured ACL settings that allow public access. It is recommended to review and update the ACL settings to restrict public access and mitigate potential security risks.

## Recommendations

1. **Restrict Public Access**: Update the ACL settings for `example-bucket-1` to remove `READ` permission for the `AllUsers` group.
2. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions to ensure no unintended public access is granted.
3. **Enable Bucket Policies**: Use bucket policies to enforce stricter access controls and prevent accidental public exposure.

## Appendix

### Sample Command to Remove Public Access

To remove the public access permission from `example-bucket-1`, the following AWS CLI command can be used:

```sh
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket example-bucket-1 --acl private
```

This command sets the ACL of the bucket to `private`, ensuring that no public access is granted.

- **S3 Buckets:** Knowing the S3 buckets helps identify where data is stored.
- **EC2 Instances:** Listing EC2 instances reveals the compute resources and their configurations.

## 3. Enumerate Permissions
Enumerating permissions involves understanding the policies and permissions associated with users, roles, and the AWS account.

### Commands Used:
- Get User Policies: `aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <username>`
- Get Role Policies: `aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <role-name>`
- Get Account Authorization Details: `aws iam get-account-authorization-details`

### Interpretation:
- **User and Role Policies:** Helps identify what actions users and roles are allowed to perform.
- **Account Authorization Details:** Provides a comprehensive view of permissions across the entire account, aiding in identifying overly permissive policies.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment
Assessing vulnerabilities involves examining the permissions and configurations of various AWS resources.

### Commands Used:
- Check S3 Bucket Permissions: `aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>`
- Describe Security Groups: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`
- Describe Network ACLs: `aws ec2 describe-network-acls`

### Interpretation:
- **S3 Bucket Permissions:** Ensures that buckets are not publicly accessible or overly permissive.
- **Security Groups and Network ACLs:** Helps identify misconfigurations that could allow unauthorized access to resources.

## 5. Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation involves simulating policy evaluation to identify potential paths to escalate privileges.

### Commands Used:
- Simulate Policy Evaluation: `aws iam simulate-principal-policy --policy-source-arn <arn> --action-names <action>`

### Interpretation:
- **Policy Evaluation:** Identifies if any policies allow actions that could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.

## 6. Exfiltration
Exfiltration involves simulating data extraction from the AWS environment to understand the risk of data breaches.

### Commands Used:

### Interpretation:
- **Data Exfiltration:** Demonstrates the potential impact of unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.

## 7. Post-Exploitation
Post-exploitation involves creating access keys and attaching policies if permissions allow to understand the extent of potential exploitation.

### Commands Used:
- Create Access Keys: `aws iam create-access-key --user-name <username>`
- Attach Policy to User/Role: `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <username> --policy-arn <policy-arn>`

### Interpretation:
- **Access Keys and Policies:** Demonstrates the ease with which an attacker could maintain persistent access or escalate privileges.

## 8. Limitations and Constraints
- Some commands require specific permissions that might not be granted to the pentester.
- The scope of the testing was limited to the resources and permissions available at the time of the test.

## 9. Conclusions and Recommendations
